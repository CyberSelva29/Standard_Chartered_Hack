<font size="+1">This text will be one size larger.</font>
Overview
The YOLOv8 model has been trained on a custom dataset specifically curated for object detection in cheque images. This model utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities. The custom dataset consists of annotated cheque images, ensuring accurate detection of various cheque components such as date, amount, payee, signature, and other relevant fields.

Key Features
Custom Dataset: The model has been trained on a carefully curated dataset of cheque images, annotated with bounding boxes around key components.
Object Detection: YOLOv8 excels at detecting multiple objects in an image simultaneously, providing comprehensive coverage of cheque elements.
Fine-tuning: The pretrained YOLOv8 architecture has been fine-tuned on the custom dataset, optimizing its performance for cheque processing tasks.
High Accuracy: Through rigorous training and validation, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying and localizing cheque components, facilitating efficient cheque processing workflows.
Usage
The trained YOLOv8 model can be seamlessly integrated into cheque processing systems, offering automated detection and extraction of essential cheque information. Its robust object detection capabilities streamline cheque verification, authentication, and data extraction processes, enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy.
